## Description ##
I present to you a 3D game of Asteroids. In the beginning, a simple menu for starting the game along with high scores is stuck. 
When the game launches we have complete control over the spaceship and weapons. The navigation of the ship in which direction to go is shown. 
The game features 2D and 3D sounds as well as spike effects. The game is created in Unity program as well as using C# scripts.
